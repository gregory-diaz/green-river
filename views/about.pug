    div(id="aboutText") VHTS is established as a small company which makes apparel and gears for grapplers. Although its major products are based on grappling gears and fighting sports apparel, our aim is to expand the market towards out door activities and street wear world wide. Surrounded by fast changing social trend and increasing complexity, we human are often neglected from fierce social competition and bypass genuine values in their lives. VHTS believes that we need to live and cooperate together in order to cope with future obstacles be it natural or human disaster. We are seeking opportunities to support solving local social problems i.e., diminish school violence through sponsoring Brazilian Jiu Jitsu after school program.
